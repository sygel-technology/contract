This module extends contract_renewal module to allow to create a new
contract line when a contract line is renewed, instead of extending the
end date of the line to renew.

Configuration
=============

To use the features provided by this module, you need to go to Invoicing
> Configuration > Settings and activate the "Create New Line At Contract
Line Renew" option under the "Contract" section.

Usage
=====

When the "Create New Line At Contract Line Renew" option in invoicing
settings is active, a new contract line will be automatically created
when an existing line is renewed. The "Date End" field in the successor
contract line will be set based on the values set in the "Renew Every"
field.

The module also allows to suspend contract lines for a given period. To
do that, click on the "Stop Plan Successor" button in the contract line
and select the start and end dates of the suspensions. The end date in
the current contract line will be set to the date selected and a new
contract line starting after the suspension period will be created.
